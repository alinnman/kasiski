# kasiski
Contains a python implementation of Kasiski's attack vs the VigenÃ¨re cipher. Simple code which can be used for demonstration/education etc. For more information see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasiski_examination

Currently it only works for Swedish text since it depends on a language sample. (Kasiski's attack is based on statistical analysis). 

* Contents:

    sample.txt = A sample of Swedish text (taken from recent newspaper articles). You may replace this file with a sample of any language. 
    
    kasiski.ini = Configuration file with language specific parameters.

    kasiski.py = A python program. 

* Building and dependencies

    It is plain Python code, and runs under v 3.10. Only built-in modules used. 

* To use the python program:

>python kasiski.py [parameters]

where parameters are

-ct   "clear text"  ## Encrypt a text string

-cit  "cipher text" ## Crack a decrypted text string

-test "clear text"  ## Run a prolonged test sequence (100 iterations with randomly generated keys) to see if cracking is feasible.
