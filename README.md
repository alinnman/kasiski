# kasiski

Contains a python implementation (CLI) of Kasiski's attack vs the VigenÃ¨re cipher. Simple code which can be used for demonstration/education etc. 
Currently it only works for Swedish text since it depends on a language sample. (Kasiski's attack is based on statistical analysis). New languages can be added easily using configuration files only.
